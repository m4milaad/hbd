        <h1>Happy Birthday, My Everything!</h1>
        <p>Nimoooooo  it's your birthday, and I'm happy and sad simultaneously happy because it's your day and now we
            are the same age, both 21 years old, but sad because I can't share it with you. It's amazing to see you
            develop, getting better in all aspects, and I feel so proud of you. You are the reason why I wish to improve
            because my biggest dream is to be your wife. Since I fell in love with you, that dream kept getting stronger
            with each passing day, and as time goes on, my affection for you continues to grow stronger. It's difficult
            to stay away from you. Goodbyes when we arrive at your bus stop and not being allowed to see you on holidays
            are too much. This Eid too, I'm not going to be able to meet you, but I would have liked to. I wished to
            speak to you, have dinner, celebrate your birthday, cut a cake, spend the day with you, stay out until
            evening, hug and kiss you, and have chocolate ice cream to conclude, that is the ideal date night I hope to
            take you one day, inshallah. I've been so looking forward to your birthday, seeing how mature and grown up
            you become each year. However, I want us to remain childish on the inside because we didn't really get a
            chance to express those sides as we grew up. We have shared not only feelings but also lives with each
            other, and it makes me more thankful for every moment I spent with you. We complete one another, and when
            home gets too much at times, we have our friendship to cling onto. I'm happy that I've already told you all
            about my family, so when I need assistance, I can go to you without any hesitation. Loving you is among the
            biggest favors God has granted me, and the day you accepted me was the best day of my life. I've never been
            this excited about anything more than waking up to see you every day. The day goes by so quickly when I'm
            with you, and all I can do is hold dear the memories we make through photos, through seconds, and in my
            heart. Each time I see our photos together, I ask myself, What good have I done in life to deserve such a
            great blessing from Allah? And I know that I should thank Him all my life. You've become my everything, a
            part of me, and for you, I want to improve constantly to be better, to be the best version of myself before
            we start our life together. This year, I wish for us to have fun and enjoy ourselves, to live each moment to
            the fullest. I wish to spend every second of my life with you because, with you, I am at peace and happy. My
            wish is to marry you, and prior to that, I wish to be the best man I can be so we can live a beautiful and
            happy life together. Living with has made it clear that you’ll be my seven minutes you’ll take all 7 of
            them. Happy birthday sweetheart may God bless you with endless happiness, good health, success in all that
            you do, and a life filled with love, peace, and prosperity. May He grant you all your heart’s desires and
            keep you safe, happy, and smiling always.</p>
        <p>With all my love, forever and always. ❤️</p>
