Although both of us were ill, we were with each other throughout the entire day, and I felt totally at ease with you. The manner in which you took care of me, asking me if I was fine and whether I was okay, even when you were also not well, touched my heart a lot. Your kindness and soft care meant a great deal to me. It demonstrated how much you care, and made me feel even nearer to you. I will always treasure that day and the warmth we had, even during our weakest moments.">
