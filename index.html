        <h1>Happy Birthday, My Sweetest Chapter!</h1>
        <p>
            Heyyyyyyy my nimooooo üíû,
            To the rest of the world, today is the 31st of July, and they're celebrating what the
            calendar informs them. But my heart shines with secret delight, for I am part of the select few who possess
            the secret.The real magic occurred on the 31st of March, the day your light really came into the world. To know this
            feels such a sacred secret between us two, and it makes me infinitely nearer to you.Happy Birthday, my love
            shur. üê£üíóIt tested us this year in ways I could never have imagined. It manged to take us through
            silences and storms, through miscommunications that appeared miles wide, and yes, even through tears. But through each trial,
            we did the most courageous thing that two human beings can do: we chose each other. Not once, but again and
            again, in every moment of turmoil. And that, I have learned, is the best definition of love. It's not a feeling; it's
            a promise we keep remaking.I've watched you, in wonder, as you've unfolded. It's not another year you've
            acquired, but a richness of perception, a humility of bearing in the face of adversity, and a resilience
            that could move mountains. To behold your soul bloom so magnificently is to love you a thousand times
            over, with each and every sunrise. You make me want to be a better person, to have peace in me, to construct
            myself into the man who is worthy to be beside a woman like you.I am not being dishonest, my heart hurts that we
            cannot celebrate today because I've replayed it in my head. No dinner shared, no cake eaten, no dramatic goodbye
            hugs at sundown, no chocolate ice cream to end the perfect day. But even from this still distance, your
            presence is the most tangible thing I know. I sense you in the beat of my heart, I sense you when I shut my
            eyes, and I hear your name in every silent prayer that I say for your happiness.Sometimes, I'll look at an
            photo of you or just your voice, and a question remains in my heart: What did I ever do to deserve a
            love like this?
            I may never know the answer. But I do know this in every fiber of my being: I will spend the
            rest of my life striving to be worthy of this miracle this love that you so freely bestow. üí´Today, and
            for all my tomorrows, I dedicate to you. Your laugh so contagious, the limitless generosity of your heart, your
            unshakable strength, your gentle softness, the brilliance of your mind, and the entirety of your beautiful
            heart. All the things that make you, you.Happy Birthday, my jaan. ü•∫‚ù§Ô∏èMay Allah bless you with a life
            abundance of blessings, filled with happiness, profound peace, and barakah in all that you do. May He grant
            you success without bounds and keep your heart always smiling.And may He, in His boundless mercy, bridge the gap between
            us, day by day, until we are no longer counting the days we are apart, but finally owning each little day
            ours. Together. Forever.Insha'Allah. ü§ç</p>
        <p>I love you endlessly‚ù§Ô∏è</p>
