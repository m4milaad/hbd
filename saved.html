<div class="carousel-slide" data-story="That day that both of us were ill is always going to be special for me. Although both of us were ill, we were with each other throughout the entire day, and I felt totally at ease with you. The manner in which you took care of me, asking me if I was fine and whether I was okay, even when you were also not well, touched my heart a lot. Your kindness and soft care meant a great deal to me. It demonstrated how much you care, and made me feel even nearer to you. I will always treasure that day and the warmth we had, even during our weakest moments.">
